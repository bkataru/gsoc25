**Tasks for Prospective GSoC 2023 Applicants for the**   
***Symbolic Calculation Project***

Below are the tasks that we will use to evaluate prospective students for the symbolic calculation. After completing the first 2 common tasks, complete the specific third task for your project (optional).

**Note:** please work in your own github branch (i.e. NO PRs should be made). Send us a link to your code when you are finished and we will evaluate it. 

**Common Task 1\.** **Dataset preprocessing** 

**Description:** Use Sympy or Mathematica to generate datasets of functions with their Taylor expansions up the fourth order. Tokenize the dataset.

**Common Task 2\. Use LSTM model**

Please train an LSTM model to learn the Taylor expansion of each function.  
You can use a deep learning algorithm of your choice (in Keras/TF or Pytorch).

**Specific Task 3: Use Transformer model**  
Please train a Transformer  model to learn the Taylor expansion of each function.
